# SQL Projects

Here are some examples of how I have used SQL to create a database and to view and analyze data. These were written in Microsoft SQL Server. 

1. **Flight database**: I set up a relational database for a fictional airline. The database contains multiple tables for storing information such as flights, passengers, staff and bookings. This was written for a Databases course.

2. **Supermarket sales**: In this short project, I used SQL to explore sales for a supermaket company. This dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales?resource=download) and contains historical sales for a supermarket company recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months.

3. **HR retention**: This exploratory analysis compares the characteristics of employees at a fictitious company in relation to employee retention. This dataset was also downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set) and was created by Dr. Carla Patalano and Dr. Rich Huebner at at New England College of Business.

# SQL Projects

Here are some examples of how I have used SQL to create a database and to view and analyze data. These were written in Microsoft SQL Server. 

1. Flight database:

I set up a relational database for a fictional airline. The database contains multiple tables for storing information on flights, staff and bookings. This was written for a Databases course.

2. Supermarket sales:

In this short project, I used SQL to explore sales for a supermaket company. This dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales?resource=download) and contains historical sales for a supermarket company recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months.
